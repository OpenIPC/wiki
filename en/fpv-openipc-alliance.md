OpenIPC Alliance for FPV
------------------------

### Introduction

The OpenIPC team has decided to create an Alliance to promote and implement certain open circuit design standards for FPV system components.

On this page we will inform everyone about all members of the Alliance and report on changes and supplement links to projects.


### Interface connector for the sensor

The first component to be standardized will be the connector between the any OpenIPC AIO main board ("UltraSight", "Thinker", "Mario") and the any OpenIPC sensor module (IMX307, IMX335, IMX347, IMX415).

We draw your attention to the fact that other modules of the other companies are **INCOMPATIBLE** and will definitely cause damage to your devices.
