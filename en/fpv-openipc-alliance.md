### OpenIPC Hardware Standardization for FPV

#### Introduction  
The OpenIPC team has launched the OpenIPC Initiative to promote the standardization and unification of FPV hardware. This initiative aims to develop open circuit design standards that enhance compatibility, improve interoperability, and accelerate the adoption of MIPI-based solutions in the FPV ecosystem.

This page provides updates on initiative members, reports on industry developments, and links to relevant projects and resources.

#### Standardized Sensor Interface Connector  
The first major step toward FPV hardware standardization is defining a universal connector between OpenIPC AIO mainboards ("UltraSight," "Thinker," "Mario") and OpenIPC sensor modules (IMX307, IMX335, IMX347, IMX415). This unified approach ensures seamless integration and consistent reliability across components.

Note that third-party sensor modules from other manufacturers are **not compatible** with OpenIPC hardware. Using non-standard components may cause hardware damage or system failure.

**Standard Connector Type:** - **DF56L-26P-0.3SD**

The receptacle (i.e. the component to place on the PCB) is actually the DF56C-26S-0.3V

By adopting and adhering to these FPV hardware standards, the OpenIPC Initiative fosters a more robust, reliable, and forward-thinking FPV ecosystem. Manufacturers who follow these standards can ensure full compatibility with OpenIPC hardware and benefit from community-driven support. However, we cannot guarantee support for devices that do not adhere to these specifications.
