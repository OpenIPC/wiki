### Updating Web UI from Web UI

In some cases, especially if you think that something does not work as it should,
try to update Web UI once more, overriding version checking for the second update.
This may be required because of some changes we have possibly made to the updating
routine, thus you shall retrieve the updating routine code with the first update,
and then use it for the consecutive update.
