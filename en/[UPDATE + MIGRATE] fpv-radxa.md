### Flashing 

* SDCard
[Link](https://github.com/OpenIPC/sbc-groundstations/releases) to latest

* EMMC
[How to flash the image to your onboard emmc](https://github.com/OpenIPC/sbc-groundstations/blob/master/radxa_pi_zero_3w/flashing_to_the_onboard_memory.md)


### Wifi

You can [setup the onboard wifi](https://github.com/OpenIPC/sbc-groundstations/blob/master/radxa_pi_zero_3w/headless_setup.md#setup-of-autoconnect-on-boot) for SSH connectivity. (udev rules and networkmanager are already configured in this image, you only need to execute the nmcli commands)

Note: for RubyFPV you will either need a USB Network Dongle like the one below

 ![Picture](../images/fpv-radxa-usbc-lan.png)

or access serial console, please check [here](https://wiki.radxa.com/Zero/dev/serial-console) on how to do that.

### GPIO Buttons

Connect a button or switch to 3.3v and physical pins 16 and 18 to increase/decrease your vrx channel. 
Connect a button or switch to physical pin 38 and 3.3v to toggle your vrx bandwidth between 20MHz and 40Mhz. 
Physical pin 32 controls DVR recording, connect a button/switch to join 3.3v and pin 32 to start/stop recordings.

(![GPIO Mappings](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b524a5a-37d8-4bc0-8bdd-e3b15b33ddf5)

To record DVR, push the button once. The stream will start and DVR will begin recording. When finished, push the button once to stop the recording and save the file.

DVR is saved to the Videos folder in your home directory. DVR can be accessed either at /home/radxa/Videos or via a media server. Connect your groundstation to your home network and it can be accessed via a web browser at x.x.x.x:8080 -- replace x.x.x.x with your groundstation's local ip address.

Connect Led long lead to +5v, Led short lead via a 1k resistor to GPIOAO_2 (The other BLUE pin on Radxa),

```bash
sudo gpioset gpiochip4 11=0      # turn LED on
sudo gpioset gpiochip4 11=1      # turn LED off (actually it is very                             # simply lit because i guess logic level 0 is not 0 volts)
```

Circuit wiring:  +5v —>  +Led- —-> 1k resistor —> pin 28 on Radxa z3w (aka the other blue pin)

<hr>

A note about the DVR recording in this image. To ease the strain on the processor, we record to to a ts file rather than mp4 or mkv. As a result, there is no "smear" effect recorded, the uncaptured frames are simply dropped. You may notice jumps in your recording where there was no frame information.
