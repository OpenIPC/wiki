Majestic Streamer
-----------------

### Preamble

Majestic is a video streaming application, the heart of our firmware (in
relation to camera/video surveillance functionality). Majestic is configurable
via /etc/majestic.yaml file, and has many features/services enabled by default.
Unneeded options can be switched off for better security and performance. See /etc/majestic.full for configuration options.

### Camera related URLs in firmware

Majestic supports multiple audio, video and still image formats, and more.
You can find the full list of available endpoints on [this page](https://openipc.org/majestic-endpoints).

The long JPEG control parameter did not fit into the example on the site and we publish it here:

`/image.jpg?width=640&height=360&qfactor=73&color2gray=1`

### How to convert YUV image to a more common image format

Use `convert` command from ImageMagick software. Run it like this:
```
convert -verbose -sampling-factor 4:2:0 -size 1920x1080 -depth 8 image.yuv image.png
```
where `1920x1080` is the picture resolution of video0, and `.png` is the target
image format.

### How to play audio stream

Use [ffplay][ffplay] utility from [ffmpeg][ffmpeg] package.
```
ffplay -ar 48000 -ac 1 -f s16le http://192.168.1.10/audio.pcm
ffplay -ar 48000 -ac 1 -f alaw http://192.168.1.10/audio.alaw
ffplay -ar 48000 -ac 1 -f mulaw http://192.168.1.10/audio.ulaw
ffplay -ar 8000 -ac 1 -f alaw http://192.168.1.10/audio.g711a
```

### How to create an audio file to play on camera's speaker over network

Using [sox][sox] program convert any source audio file to [PCM][pcm] 8kbps audio:
```
sox speech.mp3 -t raw -r 8000 -e signed -b 16 -c 1 test.pcm
```

### How to play audio file on camera's speaker over network

```
cat test.pcm | curl -v -u user:password -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST --data-binary @- http://192.168.1.10/play_audio
```
