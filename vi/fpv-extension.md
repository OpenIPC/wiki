Development of 38x38 expansion board for FPV systems
--------------------------------

Colleagues !

Who flies and who held in his hands boards of standard 38x38 video cameras, send your wishes, based on real experience, on the expansion module for FPV. 
Examples of homemade boards, that- to realize what we are talking about, you can see at the very bottom of the page (for other areas of OpenIPC use).


### Formalization of requirements

- dimensions and materials
    - standard 38x38 expansion board used in video surveillance ("sandwich")
    - double-sided glass-textolite, thickness (?)
- interfaces
    - pitch of all connectors 1.25, board mounting through metallized hole (NOT SMD!)
    - connector type, jst-gh 1.25 or df13 1.25 or something else, optionally installed
    - connector pins are duplicated with metallized holes for soldering wires
- components
    - external power supply for wifi whistle ~2-3A
    - connectors (heels) for soldering under UART (flight controller)
    - heels (connectors) for whistle connection
    - additional heels (5-12) for suspension power supply
    - indication of voltage presence by LEDs (?)
