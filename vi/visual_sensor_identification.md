# Sensor closeups
-----------------

Can be used to visually identify the actual sensor, e.g. verify online sellers are actually selling you the advertised sensor. And sometimes it's just quicker to look than getting ipctool running on a newly bought ipc.

Of interest are bondwires and pad placement.
